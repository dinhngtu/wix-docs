Sprint retrospectives end the sprint and give opportunities for the team to talk honestly about what worked well, what didn't, and how the team can do better. For Sprint 3, how did we do?


## What worked well?

We ran the installer and did so safely using Windows Sandbox.


## What could work better?

Using Windows Sandbox is pretty manual -- cutting and pasting by hand, like stone knives and bear skins. That's OK for now but it would be nice to automate some of that grunt work. We have some options in that area, so we'll look into that for a future sprint when we have a more substantial installer to test.


## What will we improve next sprint?

Though we snuck in a small tweak to the installer project, maybe it's time to start writing some WiX authoring? All in favor, say "aye." The "aye"s have it.
