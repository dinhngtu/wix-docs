During our Sprint 2 retrospective, we decided:

> So next sprint, let's figure out how to safely test the installer.

Testing is an important part of any agile software development methodology...and we've mostly been ignoring it. So far. It's time to pay the pianist and start doing the right thing and test, test, test. That's the Sprint 3 theme. Here are our tasks for the sprint:

- Planning our testing
- Running an installer...if you dare
- Enabling Windows Sandbox
- Testing in the Sandbox

Our sprint exit criteria get an upgrade this sprint: We need a sprint test plan and to execute it. With luck, testing will succeed.
