Sprint retrospectives end the sprint and give opportunities for the team to talk honestly about what worked well, what didn't, and how the team can do better.


## What worked well?

We were able to get started with an installer quickly and study it in detail.


## What could work better?

We didn't actually _do_ much during this sprint. That's OK, especially at the beginning, but let's do more real stuff soon.


## What will we improve next sprint?

Because we're creating an installer for our app, we should get a placeholder app in place and actually install it. Let's put that in the hopper for Sprint 2!
