During our Sprint 1 retrospective, we decided:

> Because we're creating an installer for our app, we should get a placeholder app in place and actually install it.

We agree (with ourselves), so let's make that the theme of Sprint 2. Here are our tasks for the sprint:

- Create the app project.
- Add a project reference.
- Replace placeholder component with app.exe.
- Rename ExampleComponents to AppComponents.
- Fix our company name.
- Build successfully.

Our sprint exit criteria continue to be pretty simple: Make sure that our changes didn't break the build.
