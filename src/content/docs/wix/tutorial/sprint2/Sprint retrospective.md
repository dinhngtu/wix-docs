Sprint retrospectives end the sprint and give opportunities for the team to talk honestly about what worked well, what didn't, and how the team can do better. For Sprint 2, how did we do?


## What worked well?

We were able to start modifying the package project and not just at random but also in preparation for installing our app.


## What could work better?

Although we're not yet installing our real app -- the team has almost decided on the color scheme, though -- we should start thinking about how we're going to test both the app and its installer. The good news is that we're ahead of the app team, so if we can keep pace, we should be able to convince everyone on the team to use the installer to test the app. That's a good example of double-dipping: We get some dedicated testing of the installer as well as the app.


## What will we improve next sprint?

OK, we convinced ourselves that testing is important. So next sprint, let's figure out how to safely test the installer. We'll be ready if the app team gets their ducks in a row. When, when the app team gets their ducks in a row.
