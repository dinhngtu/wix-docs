title: Rename ExampleComponents to AppComponents

OK, this is a pet peeve: The project generated by the HeatWave templates uses the name `ExampleComponents` in several places and while that _might_ make sense in a template, it doesn't belong in our project. These aren't examples, they're our app! Or will be, eventually. Instead of `ExampleComponents`, let's use `AppComponents`.

You can use Visual Studio's Find in Files search to find all the places `ExampleComponents` is used. Let's fix them.

Open ExampleComponents.wxs and replace `ExampleComponents` as the id of the `ComponentGroup`:

```xml
<ComponentGroup Id="AppComponents" Directory="INSTALLFOLDER">
```

Because we've renamed our component group, we also need to rename the reference to it.

Open Package.wxs and update the id of the `ComponentGroupRef`:

```xml
<Feature Id="Main">
  <ComponentGroupRef Id="AppComponents" />
</Feature>
```

And lest we forget, let's rename the WiX source file ExampleComponents.wxs to AppComponents.wxs. Right-click the file ExampleComponents.wxs in Solution Explorer and choose Rename to rename the file to AppComponents.wxs.
