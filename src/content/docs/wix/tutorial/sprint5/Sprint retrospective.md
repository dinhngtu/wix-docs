Sprint retrospectives end the sprint and give opportunities for the team to talk honestly about what worked well, what didn't, and how the team can do better. For Sprint 5, how did we do?


## What worked well?

We successfully started using a WiX extension, expanding our knowledge of the setup tools at our disposal.


## What could work better?

We're still experiencing the effects of not having all the stuff we need to do our jobs. We can sometimes cheat our way out but it's affecting our ability to adequately test the work we're doing. Without adequate testing, we risk accumulating a bunch of technical debt that will come back to us and make us work long, burnout-inducing nights and weekends at inopportune times. Let's avoid that.


## What will we improve next sprint?

We need to assert ourselves and get access to the software and hardware we need to do adequate testing. Time for a strongly-worded email...
