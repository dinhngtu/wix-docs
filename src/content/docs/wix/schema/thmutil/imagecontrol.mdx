    }}

  Relative path to an image file for the control.

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ImageId",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Identifier to the Image element that serves as the image for the control.
   Mutually exclusive with ImageFile and ImageResource and SourceX and SourceY attributes.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ImageResource",
      type: "non-negative integer"
    }}
  >
  Identifier that references an image resource with type RT_RCDATA in the module for the control.
   Mutually exclusive with ImageId and ImageFile and SourceX and SourceY attributes.

  <BlockReference
    content={{

    }}
  >
  Optional name for the control.
  
   If the ThmUtil variable callback system has been configured, such as by
   WixStandardBootstrapperApplication, ThmUtil uses the control name to
   find a matching variable name. ThmUtil retrieves the variable's value
   to set the initial value of the control and sets the variable's value
   when the user interacts with the control.
  
   For example, a checkbox control is checked when the matching variable
   has a nonzero value and unchecked for a value of `0`. When the user
   checks a checkbox control, ThmUtil sets the variable value to a nonzero
   value (currently `1`) and to `0` if the checkbox is unchecked.
  
   An edit box control gets its initial value from a matching variable
   value. The control value is saved to the variable when navigating away
   from the page or when choosing a folder via an associated Browse button.
