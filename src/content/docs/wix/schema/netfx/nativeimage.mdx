Improves the performance of managed applications by creating native images.
 Requires the .NET Framework 2.0 or newer to be installed on the target machine since
 it runs [NGen](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/ngen-exe-native-image-generator).


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "AppBaseDirectory",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The directory to use for locating dependent assemblies.
   For DLL assemblies and assemblies installed to the Global Assembly Cache (GAC),
   this attribute should be set to the directory of the application which loads this
   assembly. For EXE assemblies, this attribute does not need to be set because NGen
   will use the directory of the assembly file by default.
  
   The value can be in the form of a directory identifier, or a formatted string
   that resolves to either a directory identifier or a full path to a directory.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "AssemblyApplication",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The application which will load this assembly.
   For DLL assemblies which are loaded via reflection, this attribute should
   be set to indicate the application which will load this assembly.
   The configuration of the application (usually specified via an exe.config file) will be used
   to determine how to resolve dependencies for this assembly.
  
   The value can be in the form of a file identifier, or a formatted string
   that resolves to either a file identifier or a full path to a file.
  
   When a shared component is loaded at run time, using the Load method, the
   application's configuration file determines the dependencies that are loaded
   for the shared component â€” for example, the version of a dependency that is loaded.
   This attribute gives guidance on which dependencies would be loaded at run time in order
   to figure out which dependency assemblies will also need to have native images generated
   (assuming the Dependency attribute is not set to "no").
  
   This attribute cannot be set if the AssemblyApplication attribute is set on the parent
   File element (please note that these attributes both refer to the same application
   assembly but do very different things: specifiying File/@AssemblyApplication will force
   an assembly to install to a private location next to the indicated application, whereas
   this AssemblyApplication attribute will be used to help resolve dependent assemblies
   while generating native images for this assembly).
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Debug",
      type: "wxs:YesNoTypeUnion"
    }}
  >
  Set to "yes" to generate native images that can be used under a debugger.
   The default value is "no".
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Dependencies",
      type: "wxs:YesNoTypeUnion"
    }}
  >
  Set to "no" to generate the minimum number of native images.
   The default value is "yes".
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Identifier for the native image in the output database. If the Id is not specified, one will be generated.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Platform",
      type: "NativeImagePreprocessorPlatformType",
      typeLink: "../nativeimagepreprocessorplatformtype/",
      typeTitle: "Platform referencing the machine architecture."
    }}
  >
  Sets the platform(s) for which native images will be generated.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Priority",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  Sets the priority of generating the native images for this assembly. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *0*: This is the highest priority, it means that image generation occurs
     and completes during setup. This option ensures images are generated
     by the time setup is complete.
  - *1*: This will queue image generation to the NGen service to occur immediately.
     This option will slow down setup performance.
  - *2*: This will queue image generation to the NGen service to occur after all priority 1
     assemblies have completed.
     This option will slow down setup performance.
  - *3*: This is the lowest priority, it will queue image generation to occur when the
     machine is idle.
     This option should not slow down setup performance.
     This is the default value.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Profile",
      type: "wxs:YesNoTypeUnion"
    }}
  >
  Set to "yes" to generate native images that can be used under a profiler.
   The default value is "no".
  </BlockReference>

## Remarks

Native images are files containing compiled processor-specific machine code, which
 are installed into the native image cache on the local computer. The runtime
 can use native images from the cache instead using the just-in-time (JIT)
 compiler to compile the original assembly.

 The native image custom actions are configured to ignore failures so that failing
 to generate or remove a native image will not cause setup to fail and roll back.
