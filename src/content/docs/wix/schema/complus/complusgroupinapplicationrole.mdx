This element represents a security group membership in an
 application role. When the parent component of this element is installed, the
 user will be added to the associated application role. This element must be a
 descendent of a Component element; it can not be a child of a
 ComPlusApplicationRole locater element. To reference a locater element use the
 ApplicationRole attribute.
