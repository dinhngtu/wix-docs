Represents a DLL or assembly to be registered with COM+. If
 this element is a child of a ComPlusApplication element, the assembly will be
 registered in this application. Other ways the Application attribute must be
 set to an application. The element must be a descendent of a Component element,
 it can not be a child of a ComPlusApplication locator element.


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Application",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  If the element is not a child of a ComPlusApplication
   element, this attribute should be provided with the id of a ComPlusApplication
   element representing the application the assembly is to be registered in.
   This attribute can be omitted for a .NET assembly even if the application is
   not a child of a ComPlusApplication element.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "AssemblyName",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The name of the assembly used to identify the assembly in
   the GAC. This attribute can be provided only if DllPathFromGAC is set to
   “yes”.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DllPath",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The path to locate the assembly DLL during registration.
   This attribute should be provided if DllPathFromGAC is not set to “yes”.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DllPathFromGAC",
      type: "wxs:YesNoTypeUnion"
    }}
  >
  Indicates that the DLL path should be extracted from the
   GAC instead for being provided in the DllPath attribute. If this attribute is
   set to “yes”, the name of the assembly can be provided using the AssemblyName
   attribute. Or, if this AssemblyName attribute is missing, the name will be
   extracted from the MsiAssemblyName table using the id of the parent Component
   element.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "EventClass",
      type: "wxs:YesNoTypeUnion"
    }}
  >
  Indicates that the assembly is to be installed as an event
   class DLL. This attribute is only valid for native assemblies. The assembly
   will be installed with the COM+ catalog’s InstallEventClass() function.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  Identifier for the element.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "PSDllPath",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  An optional path to an external proxy/stub DLL for the assembly.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "RegisterInCommit",
      type: "wxs:YesNoTypeUnion"
    }}
  >
  Indicates that the assembly should be installed in the
   commit custom action instead of the normal deferred custom action. This is
   necessary when installing .NET assemblies to the GAC in the same
   installation, as the assemblies are not visible in the GAC until after the
   InstallFinalize action has run.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "TlbPath",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  An optional path to an external type lib for the assembly.
   This attribute must be provided if the Type attribute is set to “.net”.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Type",
      type: "",
      required: true
    }}
  >
   This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *native*
  - *.net*
  </BlockReference>

    }
  ]}
/>

## Remarks

When installing a native assembly, all components
 contained in the assembly must be represented as ComPlusComponent elements
 under this element. Any component not listed will not be removed during
 uninstall.

The fields DllPath, TlbPath and PSDllPath are formatted
 fields that should contain file paths to there respective file types. A typical
 value for DllPath for example, should be something like “[#MyAssembly_dll]”,
 where “MyAssembly_dll” is the key of the dll file in the File table.

 **Warning** : The assembly name provided in the AssemblyName
 attribute must be a fully specified assembly name, if a partial name is
 provided a random assembly matching the partial name will be selected.
