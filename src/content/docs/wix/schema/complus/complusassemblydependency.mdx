Defines a dependency between two assemblies. This element
 affects the order in which assembles are registered. Any assemblies referenced
 by this element are guarantied to be registered before, and unregistered after,
 the assembly referenced by the parent ComPlusAssembly element.


## Attributes

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "RequiredAssembly",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  Reference to the id of the assembly required by the parent
   ComPlusAssembly element.
  </BlockReference>

</BlockWrapper>


## Parents

<BlockDefList content={[
    {
      title: "ComPlusAssembly",
      link: "../complusassembly"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Remarks

It is only necessary to explicitly specify dependencies between
 assemblies contained in the same package (MSI or MSM). Assemblies merged in to a
 package from a merge module will always be installed before any assemblies
 specified in the base package. Assemblies merged in from different merge
 modules are sequenced using the ModuleDependency MSI table. It is not possible
 to have cross dependencies between merge modules or have an assembly in a merge
 module depend on an assembly in the base package.
