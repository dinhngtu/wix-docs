## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Action",
      type: "",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  The type of modification to be made to the XML file when the component is installed. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *createElement*: Creates a new element under the element specified in ElementPath. The Name attribute is required in this case and specifies the name of the new element. The Value attribute is not necessary when createElement is specified as the action. If the Value attribute is set, it will cause the new element's text value to be set.
  - *deleteValue*: Deletes a value from the element specified in the ElementPath. If Name is specified, the attribute with that name is deleted. If Name is not specified, the text value of the element specified in the ElementPath is deleted. The Value attribute is ignored if deleteValue is the action specified.
  - *setValue*: Sets a value in the element specified in the ElementPath. If Name is specified, and attribute with that name is set to the value specified in Value. If Name is not specified, the text value of the element is set. Value is a required attribute if setValue is the action specified.
  - *bulkSetValue*: Sets all the values in the elements that match the ElementPath. If Name is specified, attributes with that name are set to the same value specified in Value. If Name is not specified, the text values of the elements are set. Value is a required attribute if setBulkValue is the action specified.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ElementPath",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  The XPath of the element to be modified. Note that this is a formatted field and therefore, square brackets in the XPath must be escaped. In addition, XPaths allow backslashes to be used to escape characters, so if you intend to include literal backslashes, you must escape them as well by doubling them in this attribute. The string is formatted by MSI first, and the result is consumed as the XPath.

    content={{

      type: ""
    }}
  >
