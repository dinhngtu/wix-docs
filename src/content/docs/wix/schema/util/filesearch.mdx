  Rather than saving the matching file path into the variable, a FileSearch can save an attribute of the matching file instead. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *exists*: Saves true if a matching file is found; false otherwise.
  - *version*: Saves the version information for files that have it (.exe, .dll); zero-version (0.0.0.0) otherwise.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Variable",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  Name of the variable in which to place the result of the search.
  </BlockReference>
