  Rather than saving the matching key path into the variable, a ComponentSearch can save an attribute of the component instead. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *directory*: Saves the parent directory for the component's file key path; other types of key path are returned unmodified.
  - *keyPath*: Saves the key path of the component if installed. This is the default.
  - *state*: Saves the state of the component: absent (2), locally installed (3), will run from source (4), or installed in default location (either local or from source) (5)
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Variable",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  Name of the variable in which to place the result of the search.
