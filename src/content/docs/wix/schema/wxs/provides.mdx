## Remarks

This element is required for any product, feature, or bundle that will use the Dependency feature to properly reference count
 other products or features. It should be authored into a component that is always installed and removed with the
 product or features that contain it. This guarantees that product dependencies are not removed before those products that
 depend on them.

 The @Key attribute should identify a version range for your product that you guarantee will be backward compatible.
 This key is designed to persist throughout compatible upgrades so that dependent products do not have to be reinstalled
 and will not prevent your product from being upgraded. If this attribute is not authored, the value is the ProductCode
 and will not automatically support upgrades.

 By default this uses the Package/@ProductCode attribute value, which may be automatically generated.
