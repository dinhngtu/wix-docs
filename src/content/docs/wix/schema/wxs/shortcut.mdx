Shortcut, default target is parent File, CreateFolder, or Component's Directory


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Advertise",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Specifies if the shortcut should be advertised or not. Note that advertised shortcuts
   always point at a particular application, identified by a ProductCode, and should not be shared between applications.
   Advertised shortcuts only work for the most recently installed application, and are removed when that application is
   removed. The default value is 'no'.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Arguments",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The command-line arguments for the shortcut. Note that the resolution of properties
   in the Arguments field is limited. A property formatted as [Property] in this field can only be resolved if the
   property already has the intended value when the component owning the shortcut is installed. For example, for the
   argument "[#MyDoc.doc]" to resolve to the correct value, the same process must be installing the file MyDoc.doc and
   the component that owns the shortcut.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Description",
      type: "string"

  The Formatted string providing the full path to the language neutral file containing the MUI Manifest. Generally
   authored using [#filekey] form. When this attribute is specified, the DescriptionResourceId attribute must also
   be provided.
  
   This attribute is only used on Windows Vista and above. If this attribute is not specified and the install
   is running on Vista and above, the value in the Name attribute is used. If this attribute is provided and
   the install is running on Vista and above, the value in the Name attribute is ignored.

    }}
  >
  The description name index for the shortcut. This must be a non-negative number. When this attribute is specified,
   the DescriptionResourceDll attribute must also be populated.
  
   This attribute is only used on Windows Vista and above. If this attribute is not specified and the install
   is running on Vista and above, the value in the Name attribute is used. If this attribute is populated and the

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Directory",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Identifier reference to Directory element where shortcut is to be created. When nested under a Component element, this attribute's value will default to the parent directory. Otherwise, this attribute is required.

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DisplayResourceDll",
      type: "string"
    }}

   is running on Vista and above, the value in the Name attribute is used. If this attribute is populated and
   the install is running on Vista and above, the value in the Name attribute is ignored.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DisplayResourceId",
      type: "Integer",
      typeLink: "../integer/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type must be a non-negative integer or a preprocessor variable with the format `$(Variable)` or `$(var.Variable)`."
    }}
  >
  The display name index for the shortcut. This must be a non-negative number. When this attribute is specified, the
   DisplayResourceDll attribute must also be provided.

  >
  The hotkey for the shortcut. The low-order byte contains the virtual-key code for
   the key, and the high-order byte contains modifier flags. This must be a non-negative number. Authors of
   installation packages are generally recommend not to set this option, because this can add duplicate hotkeys to a
   users desktop. In addition, the practice of assigning hotkeys to shortcuts can be problematic for users using hotkeys
   for accessibility.

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Icon",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >

   as the file that it points at. For example, a shortcut to an executable (e.g. "my.exe") should reference an Icon with identifier
   like "MyIcon.exe"

      required: true
    }}
  >
  If a short name is specified, the ShortName attribute may not be specified.
   If this value is a long name, the ShortName attribute may be omitted to
   allow WiX to attempt to generate a unique short name.
   However, if this name collides with another shortcut or you wish to manually specify
   the short name, then the ShortName attribute may be specified.

   This attribute should only be set if there is a conflict between generated short names
   or the user wants to manually specify the short name.

  This attribute can only be set if this Shortcut element is nested under a Component element.
   When nested under a Component element, this attribute's value will default to the parent directory.
   This attribute's value is the target for a non-advertised shortcut.
   This attribute is not valid for advertised shortcuts.
   If you specify this value, its value should be a property identifier enclosed by square brackets ([ ]), that is expanded into the file or a folder pointed to by the shortcut.

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "WorkingDirectory",
      type: "string"
