  When the FindRelatedProducts action detects a related product installed on the system, it appends the product code to the property specified in this field. Windows Installer documentation for the [Upgrade table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/upgrade-table) states that the property specified in this field must be a public property and must be added to the [SecureCustomProperties](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa371571.aspx) property. WiX automatically appends the property specified in this field to the SecureCustomProperties property when creating an MSI. Each UpgradeVersion must have a unique Property value. After the FindRelatedProducts action is run, the value of this property is a list of product codes, separated by semicolons (;), detected on the system.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "RemoveFeatures",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The installer sets the REMOVE property to features specified in this column. The features to be removed can be determined at run time. The Formatted string entered in this field must evaluate to a comma-delimited list of feature names. For example: [Feature1],[Feature2],[Feature3]. No features are removed if the field contains formatted text that evaluates to an empty string. The installer sets REMOVE=ALL only if the Remove field is empty.
