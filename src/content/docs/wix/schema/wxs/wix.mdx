This is the top-level container element for every wxs file. Among the possible children,
 the Bundle, Package, Module, Patch elements are analogous to the main function in a C program.
 There can only be one of these present when linking occurs. Package compiles into an MSI file,
 Module compiles into an MSM file, Patch compiles into an MSP file. The Fragment element is an atomic
 unit which ultimately links into either a Package, Module. The Fragment can either be completely included or excluded during linking.
