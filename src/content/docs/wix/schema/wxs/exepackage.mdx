## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "After",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The identifier of another package that this one should be installed after. By default the After
   attribute is set to the previous sibling package in the Chain or PackageGroup element. If this
   attribute is specified ensure that a cycle is not created explicitly or implicitly.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Bundle",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Indicates the package is a WiX bundle. The default is "no".
   If "yes", then the default Protocol value is "burn".
   The engine will prepend command line arguments such as "-norestart" for all operations,
   as well as avoid running this bundle as a related bundle.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Cache",
      type: "KeepRemoveForceTypeUnion",
      typeLink: "../keepremoveforcetype/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will either be \"force\", \"keep\", or \"remove\"."
    }}
  >
  Whether to cache the package. The default is "keep".
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "CacheId",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The identifier to use when caching the package.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Compressed",
      type: "YesNoDefaultTypeUnion",
      typeLink: "../yesnodefaulttype/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will either be \"default\", \"yes\", or \"no\"."
    }}
  >
  Whether the package payload should be embedded in a container or left as an external payload.
   Must not be specified if the package payload is given by the *PackagePayload element.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Description",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Specifies the description to place in the bootstrapper application data manifest for the package. By default, ExePackages
   use the FileName field from the version information, MsiPackages use the ARPCOMMENTS property, and MspPackages use
   the Description patch metadata property. Other package types must use this attribute to define a description in the
   bootstrapper application data manifest.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DetectCondition",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  A condition that determines if the package is present on the target system. This condition can use built-in
   variables and variables returned by searches. This condition is necessary because Windows doesn't provide a
   method to detect the presence of an ExePackage. Burn uses this condition to determine how to treat this
   package during a bundle action; for example, if this condition is false or omitted and the bundle is being
   installed, Burn will install this package.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DisplayName",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Specifies the display name to place in the bootstrapper application data manifest for the package. By default, ExePackages
   use the ProductName field from the version information, MsiPackages use the ProductName property, and MspPackages use
   the DisplayName patch metadata property. Other package types must use this attribute to define a display name in the
   bootstrapper application data manifest.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DownloadUrl",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The URL to use to download the package. The following substitutions are supported:
  
  
  - \{0} is replaced by the package Id.
  - \{1} is replaced by the payload Id.
  - \{2} is replaced by the payload file name.
  Must not be specified if the package payload is given by the *PackagePayload element.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string"
    }}

    content={{
      title: "InstallSize",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >

    content={{
      title: "LogPathVariable",
