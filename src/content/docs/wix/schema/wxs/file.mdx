## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Application, from extension namespace http://www.firegiant.com/schemas/v4/wxs/heatwave/buildtools/msix",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  Allows you to specify the MSIX Application identitiy for an executable.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ApplicationRef, from extension namespace http://www.firegiant.com/schemas/v4/wxs/heatwave/buildtools/msix",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  Allows you to specify the file should contribute to an existing MSIX Application by identity.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Assembly",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  Specifies if this File is a Win32 Assembly or .NET Assembly that needs to be installed into the
   Global Assembly Cache (GAC). If the value is '.net' or 'win32', this file must also be the key path of the Component. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *.net*: The file is a .NET Framework assembly.
  - *no*: The file is not a .NET Framework or Win32 assembly. This is the default value.
  - *win32*: The file is a Win32 assembly.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "AssemblyApplication",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Specifies the file identifier of the application file. This assembly will be isolated
   to the same directory as the application file.
   If this attribute is absent, the assembly will be installed to the Global Assembly Cache (GAC).
   This attribute may only be specified if the Assembly attribute is set to '.net' or 'win32'.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "AssemblyManifest",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Specifies the file identifier of the manifest file that describes this assembly.
   The manifest file should be in the same component as the assembly it describes.
   This attribute may only be specified if the Assembly attribute is set to '.net' or 'win32'.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "BindPath",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  A list of paths, separated by semicolons, that represent the paths to be searched to find the imported DLLs. The list is usually a list of properties, with each property enclosed inside square brackets. The value may be set to an empty string. Including this attribute will cause an entry to be generated for the file in the BindImage table.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Bitness",
      type: "BitnessTypeUnion",
      typeLink: "../bitnesstype/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will be \"default\", \"always32\" or \"always64\"."
    }}
  >
  [WiX v5] Only valid when the File element is not a child of the Component element.
   Overrides the default File bitness. Only a 64-bit File can install to 64-bit locations such
   as `ProgramFiles64Folder` and the 64-bit registry. The value `always64` will force the File
   bitness to be 64-bit and cannot be included in 32-bit packages.
   Simliarly, the value `always32` will force the File bitness to 32-bit and can be included in
   32-bit or 64-bit packages.
   The default value is `default` where the File will be installed using the
   same bitness as the package.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Checksum",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  This attribute should be set to "yes" for every executable file in the installation that has a valid checksum stored in the Portable Executable (PE) file header. Only those files that have this attribute set will be verified for valid checksum during a reinstall.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "CompanionFile",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Set this attribute to make this file a companion child of another file. The installation
   state of a companion file depends not on its own file versioning information, but on the versioning of its
   companion parent. A file that is the key path for its component can not be a companion file (that means
   this attribute cannot be set if KeyPath="yes" for this file). The Version attribute cannot be set along
   with this attribute since companion files are not installed based on their own version.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Compressed",
      type: "YesNoDefaultTypeUnion",
      typeLink: "../yesnodefaulttype/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will either be \"default\", \"yes\", or \"no\"."
    }}
  >
  Sets the file's source type compression. A setting of "yes"/"true", or "no"/"false" will override the setting in the Word Count Summary Property.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Condition",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  [WiX v5] Only valid when the File element is not a child of the Component element.
   The condition expression to be evaluated at install time. When false the File will not be installed.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DefaultLanguage",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This is the default language of this file. The linker will replace this value from the value in the file if the suppress files option is not used.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DefaultSize",
      type: "Integer",
      typeLink: "../integer/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type must be a non-negative integer or a preprocessor variable with the format `$(Variable)` or `$(var.Variable)`."
    }}
  >
  This is the default size of this file. The linker will replace this value from the value in the file if the suppress files option is not used.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DefaultVersion",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This is the default version of this file. The linker will replace this value from the value in the file if the suppress files option is not used.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Directory",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  [WiX v5] Only valid when the File element is not a child of the Component element.
   This attribute specifies a reference to a Directory element with matching Id attribute containing a directory path.
   If not provided, the value will default to "INSTALLFOLDER".
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DiskId",
      type: "DiskIdType",
      typeLink: "../diskidtype/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type must be an integer or the value of one or more preprocessor variables with the format `$(Variable)` or `$(var.Variable)`."
    }}
  >
  The value of this attribute should correspond to the Id attribute of a Media
   element authored elsewhere. By creating this connection between a file and
   its media, you set the packaging options to the values specified in the Media
   element (values such as compression level, cab embedding, etc...). Specifying
   the DiskId attribute on the File element overrides the default DiskId attribute
   from the parent Component element. If no DiskId attribute is specified,
   the default is "1". This DiskId attribute is ignored when creating a merge module
   because merge modules do not have media.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ExternalApplicationRef, from extension namespace http://www.firegiant.com/schemas/v4/wxs/heatwave/buildtools/msix",

    }}
  >
