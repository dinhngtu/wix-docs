import BlockReference from '@components/BlockReference.astro';
import BlockDefList from '@components/BlockDefList.astro';

Used only for PatchFamilies to include all changes between the baseline and upgraded packages in a patch.


## Parents

<BlockDefList content={[
    {
      title: "PatchFamily",
      link: "../patchfamily/"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Remarks

Warning: this is intended for testing purposes only. Shipping a patch with all changes negates the benefits of using patch families for including only specific changes.

Because changing the ProductCode is not supported in a patch, the ProductCode property is automatically removed from the transform.
