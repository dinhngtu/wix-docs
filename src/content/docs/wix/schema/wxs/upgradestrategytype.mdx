title: "UpgradeStrategyType type"
---

Use this attribute to specify the installation scope of this package: major upgrade or none.

## Enumeration values

  - *majorUpgrade*: Set this value to declare that the package will be upgraded via major upgrades.
     You can author a major upgrade with your preferred options or a default major
     upgrade will be provided if you don't. The UpgradeCode attribute is required.
  - *none*: Set this value to declare that the package will not support major upgrades.
     This value is _not_ recommended because it means a product cannot be serviced
     in the event of major bug or security vulnerability.
