The Patch element is analogous to the main function in a C program. When linking, only one Patch section
 can be given to the linker to produce a successful result. Using this element creates an MSP file.

## Remarks

You can specify any valid Windows code by by integer like 1252, or by web name like Windows-1252. See [Code pages](../../tools/codepage/) for more information.

The ClientPatchId attribute allows you to specify an easily referenced identity that you can use in product authoring. This identity prefixes properties added by WiX to a patch transform, such as _ClientPatchId_ .PatchCode and _ClientPatchId_ .AllowRemoval. If the patch code GUID is auto-generated you could not reference any properties using this auto-generated prefix.

For example, if you were planning to ship a patch referred to as "QFE1" and needed to write your own registry values for Add/Remove Programs in product authoring such as the UninstallString for this patch, you could author a RegistryValue with the name UninstallString and the value `[SystemFolder]msiexec.exe /package [ProductCode] /uninstall [QFE1.PatchCode]` . In your patch authoring you would then set ClientPatchId to "QFE1" and WiX will add the QFE1.PatchCode property to the patch transform when the patch is created. If the Id attribute specified the patch code to be generated automatically, you could not reference the _prefix_ .PatchCode property as shown above.

The summary information is automatically populated from attribute values of the Patch element including the code page. If you want to override some of these summary information properties or use a different code page for the summary information itself, author the PatchInformation element.
