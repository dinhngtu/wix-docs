The Module element is analogous to the main function in a C program. When linking, only
 one Module section can be given to the linker to produce a successful result. Using this
 element creates an msm file.


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Codepage",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The code page integer value or web name for the resulting MSM. You can specify any valid Windows
   code by by integer like 1252, or by web name like Windows-1252. See [Code pages](../../../tools/codepage/)
   for more information.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Guid",
      type: "Guid",

    }}
  >
  The GUID of the Merge Module that will be appended to primary keys in the database.

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string",
      required: true

    }}
  >
  The minimum version of the Windows Installer required to install this package. Take the major version of the required Windows Installer
   and multiply by a 100 then add the minor version of the Windows Installer. For example, "200" would represent Windows Installer 2.0 and
   "405" would represent Windows Installer 4.5. This value is defaulted to "500" which is the latest version of the Windows Installer and
   present in Windows 7 and later.
