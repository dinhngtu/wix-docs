  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Name",
      type: "LongFileNameType",
      typeLink: "../longfilenametype/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will look like: \"Long File Name.extension\". Legal long names contain no more than 260 characters and must contain at least one non-period character. The following characters are not allowed: \\ ? | > : / * \" or \\<. The name must be shorter than 260 characters. The value could also be a localization variable with the format !(loc.VARIABLE)."
    }}
  >
  In prior versions of the WiX toolset, this attribute specified the short file name.
   This attribute's value may now be either a short or long file name.
   If a short file name is specified, the ShortName attribute may not be specified.
   If you wish to manually specify the short file name, then the ShortName
   attribute may be specified.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ShortName",
      type: "ShortFileNameType",
      typeLink: "../shortfilenametype/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will look like: \"FileName.ext\". Only one period is allowed. The following characters are not allowed: \\ ? | > : / * \" + , ; = [ ] \\<, or whitespace. The name cannot exceed 8 characters and the extension cannot exceed 3 characters. The value could also be a localization variable with the format !(loc.VARIABLE)."
    }}
  >
  The short file name of the file in 8.3 format.
   There is a Windows Installer bug which prevents the FileSearch functionality from working
   if both a short and long file name are specified. Since the Name attribute allows either
   a short or long name to be specified, it is the only attribute related to file names which
   should be specified.
