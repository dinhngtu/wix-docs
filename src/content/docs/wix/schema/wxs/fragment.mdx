The Fragment element is the building block of creating an installer database in WiX. Once defined,
 the Fragment becomes an immutable, atomic unit which can either be completely included or excluded
 from a product. The contents of a Fragment element can be linked into a product by utilizing one
 of the many *Ref elements. When linking in a Fragment, it will be necessary to link in all of its
 individual units. For instance, if a given Fragment contains two Component elements, you must link
 both under features using ComponentRef for each linked Component. Otherwise, you will get a linker
 warning and have a floating Component that does not appear under any Feature.
