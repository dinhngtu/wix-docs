import BlockWrapper from '@components/BlockWrapper.astro';
import BlockReference from '@components/BlockReference.astro';
import BlockDefList from '@components/BlockDefList.astro';

Create a reference to a Feature element in another Fragment.


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  The identifier of the Feature element to reference.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "IgnoreParent",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Normally feature references that are nested under a parent element create a connection to that
   parent. This behavior is undesirable when trying to simply reference a Feature in a different
   Fragment. Specify 'yes' to have this feature reference not create a connection to its parent.
   The default is 'no'.
  </BlockReference>

</BlockWrapper>
