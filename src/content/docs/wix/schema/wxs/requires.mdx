## Remarks

This element declares a dependency on any product that uses the Provides element. If that product is uninstalled
 before a product that requires it, the uninstall will err or warn the user that other products are installed
 which depend on that product. This behavior can be modified by changing the attribute values on the Requires element.

If you do not nest this element under a Provides element, you must specify the @Id attribute
 so that it can be referenced by a RequiresRef element nested under a Provides element.
