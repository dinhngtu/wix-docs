Authoring to define the set of files to be harvested for inclusion in a package.


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Directory",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This attribute specifies a reference to a Directory element with matching Id attribute containing a directory path
   for the root of the harvested files.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Include",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  A file-selection pattern that can include directory names, file names, and wildcards.
   If a pattern is not an absolute path (via a preprocessor variable, unnamed bind path,
   or named bind path), it is interpreted as relative to the directory containing the
   source file. Absolute paths via a named bind path are recommended.
  
   Wildcards include typical `*.ext` globs and MSBuild-style `**` globs to indicate
   that directories should be recursed. Examples include:
  
   | Pattern | Description |
   | ------- | ----------- |
   | `!(bindpath.ToBeHarvested)\**` | All files in the parent directory identified by the `ToBeHarvested` bind path and its subdirectories. |
   | `$(PayloadFiles)\bin\Release\**` | All files in the `bin\Release` subdirectory in the directory named by the `PayloadFiles` preprocessor variable and its subdirectories. |
   | `!(bindpath.arm64)\**.pdb` | All files with `.pdb` extension in the parent directory identified by the `arm64` bind path and its subdirectories. |
   | `**` | If an unnamed bind path was specified, all files in that directory and its subdirectories. If an unnamed bind path was _not_ specified, all files in directory of the source .wxs file and its subdirectories. |
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Subdirectory",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This attribute defines one or more directories below the directory referenced by the Directory attribute.
   This attribute is optional but can only be specified when the Directory attribute is also specified.
  </BlockReference>
