Specifies a table from the merge module that is not merged into an .msi file.
 If the table already exists in an .msi file, it is not modified by the merge.
 The specified table can therefore contain data that is unneeded after the merge.
 To minimize the size of the .msm file, it is recommended that developers remove
 unused tables from modules intended for redistribution rather than creating
 IgnoreTable elements for those tables.
