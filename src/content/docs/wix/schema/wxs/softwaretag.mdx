## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Bitness",
      type: "BitnessTypeUnion",
      typeLink: "../bitnesstype",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will be \"default\", \"always32\" or \"always64\"."
    }}
  >
  This attribute facilitates the installation of packages that install both 32-bit and 64-bit files. Set this attribute to 'always32'
   force the software id tag to a 32-bit location (such as "ProgramFilesFolder") or 'always64' to force the tag to be installed to
   a 64-bit location (such as "ProgramFiles64Folder").
  
   The default value is `default` where the tag will be installed to the directory that matches the
   same bitness as the package.
  
   This attribute is only allowed on a SoftwareTag element found under a Package element.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Feature",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Optional attribute to explicitly set the Feature when defining the software id tag
   in a Package. By default the software id tag will always be installed by a top-level hidden feature.
   It is recommended to **not** set this attribute.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "InstallDirectory",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  A reference to an existing Directory/@Id where the software is installed. The SWID tag file will be installed in a "swidtag" folder
   under that directory as per the specification. This attribute is required on a SoftwareTag element found under a Package element.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "InstallPath",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The path where the software is installed. The SWID tag file will be installed in a "swidtag" folder.
   This is a formatted attribute so it is possible to use Variables as the InstallPath by setting
   the value to, for example, "[ProgramFilesFolder]CompanyName\Product Name". This attribute is required
   on a SoftwareTag element found under a Bundle element.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Name",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Name to use in the filename for the software id tag. By default the filename
   uses the Bundle/@Name or Package/@Name. If the bundle name or package name contains
   invalid filename characters such as ":" or "?", use this attribute to provide
   a valid filename.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Regid",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  The regid for the software manufacturer. A regid is a URI simplified for the common
   case. Namely, if the scheme is "http://", it can be removed. Additionally, the domain
   should be minimized as much as possible (for example, remove "www." prefix if unnecessary).
  
   For example, the WiX toolset regid is "wixtoolset.org".
