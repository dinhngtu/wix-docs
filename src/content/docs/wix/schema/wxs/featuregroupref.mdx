Create a reference to a FeatureGroup in another Fragment.


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  The identifier of the FeatureGroup to reference.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "IgnoreParent",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Normally feature group references that end up nested under a parent element create a
   connection to that parent. This behavior is undesirable when trying to simply reference
   to a FeatureGroup in a different Fragment. Specify 'yes' to have this feature group
   reference not create a connection to its parent. The default is 'no'.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Primary",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Set this attribute to 'yes' in order to make the parent feature of this group
   the primary feature for any components and merges contained in the group.
   Features may belong to multiple features. By designating a feature as the
   primary feature of a component or merge, you ensure that whenever a component is
   selected for install-on-demand (IOD), the primary feature will be the one to install
   it. This attribute should only be set if a component actually nests under multiple
   features. If a component nests under only one feature, that feature is the primary
   feature for the component. You cannot set more than one feature as the primary
   feature of a given component.
  </BlockReference>
