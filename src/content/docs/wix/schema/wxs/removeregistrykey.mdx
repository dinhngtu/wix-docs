## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Action",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  This is the action that will be taken for this registry value. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *removeOnInstall*: Removes a key with all its values and subkeys when the parent component is installed.
  - *removeOnUninstall*: Removes a key with all its values and subkeys when the parent component is uninstalled.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Primary key used to identify this particular entry. If this attribute is not specified, an identifier will be
   generated by hashing the parent Component identifier, Root, Key, and Name.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Key",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The localizable key for the registry value.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Root",
      type: "RegistryRootType",
      typeLink: "../registryroottype/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type represent possible registry roots."
    }}
  >
  The predefined root key for the registry value. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *HKMU*: A per-user installation will make the operation occur under HKEY_CURRENT_USER.
     A per-machine installation will make the operation occur under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
  - *HKCR*: Operation occurs under HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT. When using Windows 2000 or later, the installer writes or removes the value
     from the HKCU\Software\Classes hive during per-user installations. When using Windows 2000 or later operating systems,
     the installer writes or removes the value from the HKLM\Software\Classes hive during per-machine installations.
  - *HKCU*: Operation occurs under HKEY_CURRENT_USER. It is recommended to set the KeyPath attribute to `yes` when setting this value for writing values
     in order to ensure that the installer writes the necessary registry entries when there are multiple users on the same computer.
  - *HKLM*: Operation occurs under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE.
  - *HKU*: Operation occurs under HKEY_USERS.
