Simplifies authoring for major upgrades, including support for preventing downgrades.

 The parent Package element must have valid UpgradeCode and Version attributes.

 When the FindRelatedProducts action detects a related product installed on the system,
 it appends the product code to the property named WIX_UPGRADE_DETECTED. After the
 FindRelatedProducts action is run, the value of the WIX_UPGRADE_DETECTED property is a
 list of product codes, separated by semicolons (;), detected on the system.


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "AllowDowngrades",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  When set to no (the default), products with lower version numbers are blocked from
   installing when a product with a higher version is installed; the DowngradeErrorMessage
   attribute must also be specified.
  
   When set to yes, any version can be installed over any other version.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "AllowSameVersionUpgrades",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  When set to no (the default), installing a product with the same version and upgrade code
   (but different product code) is allowed and treated by MSI as two products. When set to yes,
   WiX sets the msidbUpgradeAttributesVersionMaxInclusive attribute, which tells MSI to treat
   a product with the same version as a major upgrade.
  
   This is useful when two product versions differ only in the fourth version field. MSI
   specifically ignores that field when comparing product versions, so two products that
   differ only in the fourth version field are the same product and need this attribute set to
   yes to be detected.
  
   Note that because MSI ignores the fourth product version field, setting this attribute to
   yes also allows downgrades when the first three product version fields are identical.
   For example, product version 1.0.0.1 will "upgrade" 1.0.0.2998 because they're seen as the
   same version (1.0.0). That could reintroduce serious bugs so the safest choice is to change
   the first three version fields and omit this attribute to get the default of no.
  
   This attribute cannot be "yes" when AllowDowngrades is also "yes" -- AllowDowngrades
   already allows two products with the same version number to upgrade each other.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Disallow",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  When set to yes, products with higer version numbers are blocked from
   installing when a product with a lower version is installed; the UpgradeErrorMessage
   attribute must also be specified.
  
   When set to no (the default), any version can be installed over any lower version.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DisallowUpgradeErrorMessage",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The message displayed if users try to install a product with a higer version number
   when a product with a lower version is installed. Used only when Disallow
   is yes.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DowngradeErrorMessage",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The message displayed if users try to install a product with a lower version number
   when a product with a higher version is installed. Used only when AllowDowngrades
   is no (the default).
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "IgnoreLanguage",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  When set to yes, the Upgrade table rows will match any product with the same UpgradeCode.
  
   When set to no (the default), the Upgrade table rows will match only products with the
   same UpgradeCode and ProductLanguage.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "IgnoreRemoveFailure",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  When set to yes, failures removing the installed product during the upgrade will be
   ignored.
  
   When set to no (the default), failures removing the installed product during the upgrade
   will be considered a failure and, depending on the scheduling, roll back the upgrade.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "MigrateFeatures",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  When set to yes (the default), the MigrateFeatureStates standard action will set the
   feature states of the upgrade product to those of the installed product.
  
   When set to no, the installed features have no effect on the upgrade installation.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "RemoveFeatures",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  A formatted string that contains the list of features to remove from the installed
   product. The default is to remove all features. Note that if you use formatted property
   values that evaluate to an empty string, no features will be removed; only omitting
   this attribute defaults to removing all features.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Schedule",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  Determines the scheduling of the RemoveExistingProducts standard action, which is when
   the installed product is removed. The default is "afterInstallValidate" which removes
   the installed product entirely before installing the upgrade product. It's slowest but
   gives the most flexibility in changing components and features in the upgrade product.
  
   For more information, see [RemoveExistingProducts](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/removeexistingproducts-action) . This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *afterInstallValidate*: (Default) Schedules RemoveExistingProducts after the InstallValidate standard
     action. This scheduling removes the installed product entirely before installing
     the upgrade product. It's slowest but gives the most flexibility in changing
     components and features in the upgrade product. Note that if the installation
     of the upgrade product fails, the machine will have neither version installed.
  - *afterInstallInitialize*: Schedules RemoveExistingProducts after the InstallInitialize standard action.
     This is similar to the afterInstallValidate scheduling, but if the installation
     of the upgrade product fails, Windows Installer also rolls back the removal of
     the installed product -- in other words, reinstalls it.
  - *afterInstallExecute*: Schedules RemoveExistingProducts between the InstallExecute and InstallFinalize standard actions.
     This scheduling installs the upgrade product "on top of" the installed product then lets
     RemoveExistingProducts uninstall any components that don't also exist in the upgrade product.
     Note that this scheduling requires strict adherence to the component rules because it relies
     on component reference counts to be accurate during installation of the upgrade product and
     removal of the installed product. For more information, see [Bob Arnson's blog post "Paying for Upgrades"](http://www.joyofsetup.com/2008/12/30/paying-for-upgrades/) for details. If installation of the upgrade product fails, Windows Installer
     also rolls back the removal of the installed product -- in other words, reinstalls it.
  - *afterInstallExecuteAgain*: Schedules RemoveExistingProducts between the InstallExecuteAgain and InstallFinalize standard actions.
     This is identical to the afterInstallExecute scheduling but after the InstallExecuteAgain standard
     action instead of InstallExecute.
  - *afterInstallFinalize*: Schedules RemoveExistingProducts after the InstallFinalize standard action. This is similar to the
     afterInstallExecute and afterInstallExecuteAgain schedulings but takes place outside the
     installation transaction so if installation of the upgrade product fails, Windows Installer does
     not roll back the removal of the installed product, so the machine will have both versions
     installed.
