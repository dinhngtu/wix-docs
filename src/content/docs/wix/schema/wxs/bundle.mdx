## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "AboutUrl",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  A URL for more information about the bundle to display in Programs and Features (also
   known as Add/Remove Programs).
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "CommandLineVariables, from extension namespace http://wixtoolset.org/schemas/v4/wxs/bal",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  This value determines whether case sensitivity is used to match overridable variables specified on the command line. The default is "caseSensitive". This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *caseSensitive*
  - *caseInsensitive*
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Compressed",
      type: "YesNoDefaultTypeUnion",
      typeLink: "../yesnodefaulttype/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will either be \"default\", \"yes\", or \"no\"."
    }}
  >
  Whether Packages and Payloads not assigned to a container should be added to the default attached container or if they should be external. The default is yes.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Condition",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The condition of the bundle. If the condition is not met, the bundle will
   refuse to run. Conditions are checked before the bootstrapper application is loaded
   (before detect), and thus can only reference built-in variables such as
   variables which indicate the version of the OS.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Copyright",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The legal copyright found in the version resources of final bundle executable. If
   this attribute is not provided the copyright will be set to "Copyright (c) [Bundle/@Manufacturer]. All rights reserved.".
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DisableModify",
      type: "YesNoButtonTypeUnion",
      typeLink: "../yesnobuttontype/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will either be \"button\", \"yes\"/\"true\", or \"no\"/\"false\"."
    }}
  >
  Determines whether the bundle can be modified via the Programs and Features (also known as
   Add/Remove Programs). If the value is "button" then Programs and Features will show a single
   "Uninstall/Change" button. If the value is "yes" then Programs and Features will only show
   the "Uninstall" button". If the value is "no", the default, then a "Change" button is shown.
   See the DisableRemove attribute for information how to not display the bundle in Programs
   and Features.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DisableRemove",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Determines whether the bundle can be removed via the Programs and Features (also
   known as Add/Remove Programs). If the value is "yes" then the "Uninstall" button will
   not be displayed. The default is "no" which ensures there is an "Uninstall" button to
   remove the bundle. If the "DisableModify" attribute is also "yes" or "button" then the
   bundle will not be displayed in Progams and Features and another mechanism (such as
   registering as a related bundle addon) must be used to ensure the bundle can be removed.
  </BlockReference>

    content={{
      title: "HelpTelephone",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >

      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Optional name to display in Add/Remove Programs while the bundle is being installed, uninstalled, repaired.

      title: "Manufacturer",

      title: "ParentName",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The name of the parent bundle to display in Installed Updates (also known as Add/Remove
   Programs). This name is used to nest or group bundles that will appear as updates.

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ProviderKey",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Optional attribute to explicitly author the provider key for the entire bundle.This provider key is designed to persist throughout compatible upgrades so that dependent bundles do not have to be reinstalled
   and will not prevent your product from being upgraded. If this attribute is not authored, the value is the
   automatically-generated bundle ID and will not automatically support upgrades.
  
  Only a single provider key is supported for bundles. To author that your bundle provides additional features via
   packages, author different provider keys for your packages.
