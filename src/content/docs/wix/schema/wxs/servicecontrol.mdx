Starts, stops, and removes services for parent Component. This element is used to control the state
 of a service installed by the MSI or MSM file by using the start, stop and remove attributes.
 For example, Start='install' Stop='both' Remove='uninstall' would mean: start the service on install,
 remove the service when the product is uninstalled, and stop the service both on install and uninstall.
