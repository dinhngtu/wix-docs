    }}

## Parents

<BlockDefList content={[
    {
      title: "PatchCreation",
      link: "../patchcreation/"
    },
    {
      title: "TargetProductCodes",
      link: "../targetproductcodes/"
    }
  ]}
/>

## Remarks

When using the PatchCreation element, if the Id attribute value is '*' or this element is not authored, the product codes of all products referenced by the TargetImages element are used.

When using the Patch element, the Id attribute value must not be '*'. Use the TargetProductCodes/@Replace attribute instead.
