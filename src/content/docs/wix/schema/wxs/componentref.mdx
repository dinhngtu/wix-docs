Create a reference to a Feature element in another Fragment.
 _New in WiX v5: Can be a child of the `Package` element._


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  The identifier of the Component element to reference.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Primary",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Set this attribute to 'yes' in order to make the parent feature of this component
   the primary feature for this component. Components may belong to multiple features.
   By designating a feature as the primary feature of a component, you ensure that
   whenever a component is selected for install-on-demand (IOD), the primary feature
   will be the one to install it. This attribute should only be set if a component
   actually nests under multiple features. If a component nests under only one feature,
   that feature is the primary feature for the component. You cannot set more than one
   feature as the primary feature of a given component.
  </BlockReference>

</BlockWrapper>
