  Excludes files from the set of files harvested via the parent `Files` element.
   Inclusion and exclusion wildcards must match paths. For example, if you have a
   `Files` element with `Include="!(bindpath.ToBeHarvested)\**"` and want to
   exclude one of the files, use an `Exclude` element with a `Files` attribute
   like `!(bindpath.ToBeHarvested)\notatest.txt` to match the inclusion path.
   You can also use the `**` wildcard to match directories, such as
   `Files="**\pleasedontincludeme.dat"`.
  
   The file-selection pattern can include directory names, file names, and wildcards.
   If a pattern is not an absolute path (via a preprocessor variable, unnamed bind path,
   or named bind path), it is interpreted as relative to the directory containing the
   source file. Absolute paths via a named bind path are recommended.
  
   Wildcards include typical `*.ext` globs and MSBuild-style `**` globs to indicate
   that directories should be recursed. Examples include:
  
   | Pattern | Description |
   | ------- | ----------- |
   | `!(bindpath.ToBeHarvested)\**` | All files in the parent directory identified by the `ToBeHarvested` bind path and its subdirectories. |
   | `$(PayloadFiles)\bin\Release\**` | All files in the `bin\Release` subdirectory in the directory named by the `PayloadFiles` preprocessor variable and its subdirectories. |
   | `!(bindpath.arm64)\**.pdb` | All files with `.pdb` extension in the parent directory identified by the `arm64` bind path and its subdirectories. |
   | `**` | If an unnamed bind path was specified, all files in that directory and its subdirectories. If an unnamed bind path was _not_ specified, all files in directory of the source .wxs file and its subdirectories. |
