## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  Id of the search being referred to.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Parent",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This attribute is the signature of the parent directory of the file or directory in the Signature_ column. If this field is null, and the Path column does not expand to a full path, then all the fixed drives of the user's system are searched by using the Path. This field is a key into one of the following tables: the RegLocator, the IniLocator, the CompLocator, or the DrLocator tables.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Path",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Path on the user's system. Either absolute, or relative to containing directories.
  </BlockReference>

</BlockWrapper>

## Remarks

A reference to another DirectorySearch element must reference the same Id, the same Parent Id, and the same Path. If any of these attribute values are different you must instead use a DirectorySearch element.
