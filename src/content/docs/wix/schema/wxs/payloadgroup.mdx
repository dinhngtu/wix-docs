import BlockWrapper from '@components/BlockWrapper.astro';
import BlockReference from '@components/BlockReference.astro';
import BlockDefList from '@components/BlockDefList.astro';

Describes a payload group to a bootstrapper. PayloadGroups referenced from within a Bundle are tied to the Bundle.
 PayloadGroups referenced from a Fragment are tied to the context of whatever references them such as an ExePackage or MsiPackage.
 It is possible to share a PayloadGroup between multiple Packages and/or a Bundle by creating multiple references to it.
