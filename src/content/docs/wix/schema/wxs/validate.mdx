## Remarks

A transform contains the differences between the target product and the upgraded product. When a transform or a patch (which contains transforms) is applied, the following properties of the installed product are validated against the properties of the target product stored in a transform.


- ProductCode
- ProductLanguage
- ProductVersion
- UpgradeCode
Windows Installer simply validates that the ProductCode, ProductLanguage, and UpgradeCode of an installed product are equivalent to those propeties of the target product used to create the transform; however, the ProductVersion can be validated with a greater range of comparisons.

You can compare up to the first three fields of the ProductVersion. Changes to the fourth field are not validated and are useful for small updates. You can also choose how to compare the target ProductVersion used to create the transform with the installed ProductVersion. For example, while the default value of 'Equals' is recommended, if you wanted a minor upgrade patch to apply to the target ProductVersion and all older products with the same ProductCode, you would use 'LesserOrEqual'.
