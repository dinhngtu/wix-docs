COM Class registration for parent Component.


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Advertise",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Set this value to "yes" in order to create a normal Class table row. Set this value to
   "no" in order to generate Registry rows that perform similar registration (without the
   often problematic Windows Installer advertising behavior).
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "AppId",
      type: "Guid",
      typeLink: "../guid/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will look like: \"01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF\" or \"{01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF}\". Also allows \"PUT-GUID-HERE\" for use in examples."
    }}
  >
  This attribute is only allowed when a Class is advertised. Using this attribute will reference an Application ID
   containing DCOM information for the associated application GUID. The value must correspond to an AppId/@Id of an
   AppId element nested under a Fragment, Module, or Package element. To associate an AppId with a non-advertised
   class, nest the class within a parent AppId element.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Argument",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This column is optional only when the Context column is set to "LocalServer"
   or "LocalServer32" server context. The text is registered as the argument against
   the OLE server and is used by OLE for invoking the server. Note that the resolution
   of properties in the Argument field is limited. A property formatted as [Property] in
   this field can only be resolved if the property already has the intended value when
   the component owning the class is installed. For example, for the argument "[#MyDoc.doc]"
   to resolve to the correct value, the same process must be installing the file MyDoc.doc and the
   component that owns the class.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Context",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  The server context(s) for this COM server. This attribute is optional for VB6 libraries that are marked "PublicNotCreateable".
   Class elements marked Advertised must specify at least one server context. It is most common for there to be a single value
   for the Context attribute.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Control",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Set this attribute's value to 'yes' to identify an object as an ActiveX Control. The default value is 'no'.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Description",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Localized description associated with the Class ID and Program ID.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ForeignServer",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  May only be specified if the value of the Advertise attribute is "no" and Server has not been specified. In addition, it may only
   be used when the Class element is directly under the Component element. The value can be
   that of an registry type (REG_SZ). This attribute should be used to specify foreign servers, such as mscoree.dll if needed.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Handler",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The default inproc handler. May be optionally provided only for Context = LocalServer or
   LocalServer32. Value of "1" creates a 16-bit InprocHandler (appearing as the InprocHandler
   value). Value of "2" creates a 32-bit InprocHandler (appearing as the InprocHandler32 value).
   Value of "3" creates 16-bit as well as 32-bit InprocHandlers. A non-numeric value is treated
   as a system file that serves as the 32-bit InprocHandler (appearing as the InprocHandler32 value).
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Icon",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The file providing the icon associated with this CLSID. Reference to an Icon element
   (should match the Id attribute of an Icon element). This is currently not supported if the
   value of the Advertise attribute is "no".
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "IconIndex",
      type: "Integer",
      typeLink: "../integer/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type must be a non-negative integer or a preprocessor variable with the format `$(Variable)` or `$(var.Variable)`."
    }}
  >
  Icon index into the icon file.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "Guid",
      typeLink: "../guid/",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will look like: \"01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF\" or \"{01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF}\". Also allows \"PUT-GUID-HERE\" for use in examples.",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  The Class identifier (CLSID) of a COM server.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Insertable",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Specifies the CLSID may be insertable.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Programmable",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Specifies the CLSID may be programmable.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "RelativePath",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  When the value is "yes", the bare file name can be used for COM servers. The installer
   registers the file name only instead of the complete path. This enables the server in
   the current directory to take precedence and allows multiple copies of the same component.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "SafeForInitializing",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  May only be specified if the value of the Advertise attribute is "no".
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "SafeForScripting",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  May only be specified if the value of the Advertise attribute is "no".
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Server",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  May only be specified if the value of the Advertise attribute is "no" and the ForeignServer attribute is not specified. File Id of the
   COM server file. If this element is nested under a File element, this value defaults to
   the value of the parent File/@Id.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ShortPath",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Specifies whether or not to use the short path for the COM server. This can only apply when Advertise is set to 'no'. The default is 'no' meaning that it will use the long file name for the COM server.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ThreadingModel",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  Threading model for the CLSID. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *apartment*
  - *free*
  - *both*
  - *neutral*
  - *single*
  - *rental*
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Version",
      type: "string"
    }}

  Version for the CLSID.
