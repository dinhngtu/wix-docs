## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Action",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  Specfies whether the environmental variable should be created, set or removed when the parent component is installed. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *create*: Creates the environment variable if it does not exist, then set it during installation. This has no effect on the value of the environment variable if it already exists.
  - *set*: Creates the environment variable if it does not exist, and then set it during installation. If the environment variable exists, set it during the installation.
  - *remove*: Removes the environment variable during an installation.
     The installer only removes an environment variable during an installation if the name and value
     of the variable match the entries in the Name and Value attributes.
     If you want to remove an environment variable, regardless of its value, do not set the Value attribute.
