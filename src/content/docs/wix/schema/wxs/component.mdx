## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Bitness",
      type: "BitnessTypeUnion",
      typeLink: "../bitnesstype",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type will be \"default\", \"always32\" or \"always64\"."
    }}
  >
  Overrides the default Component bitness. Only 64-bit Components can install to 64-bit locations such
   as `ProgramFiles64Folder` and the 64-bit registry. The value `always64` will force the Component
   bitness to be 64-bit and cannot be included in 32-bit packages.
   Simliarly, the value `always32` will force the Component bitness to 32-bit and can be included in
   32-bit or 64-bit packages.
   The default value is `default` where the Component will be installed using the
   same bitness as the package.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ComPlusFlags",
      type: "Integer",
      typeLink: "../integer",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type must be a non-negative integer or a preprocessor variable with the format `$(Variable)` or `$(var.Variable)`."
    }}
  >
  Set this attribute to create a ComPlus entry. The value should be the export flags used
   during the generation of the .msi file. For more information see the COM+ documentation
   in the Platform SDK.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Condition",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The condition expression to be evaluated at install time. When false the Component will not be installed.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Directory",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Sets the Directory of the Component. If this element is nested under a Directory element,
   this value defaults to the value of the parent Directory/@Id.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DisableRegistryReflection",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Set this attribute to 'yes' in order to disable registry reflection on all existing and
   new registry keys affected by this component.
   When set to 'yes', the Windows Installer calls the RegDisableReflectionKey on each key
   being accessed by the component.
   This bit is available with Windows Installer version 4.0 and is ignored on 32-bit systems.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DiskId",
      type: "DiskIdType",
      typeLink: "../diskidtype",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type must be an integer or the value of one or more preprocessor variables with the format `$(Variable)` or `$(var.Variable)`."
    }}
  >
  This attribute provides a default DiskId attribute for all child File elements. Specifying
   the DiskId on a Component element will override any DiskId attributes set by parent Directory
   or DirectoryRef elements. See the File element's DiskId attribute for more information about
   the purpose of the DiskId.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Feature",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Identifies a feature to which this component belongs, as a shorthand for a child
   ComponentRef element of the Feature element. The value of this attribute should
   correspond to the Id attribute of a Feature element authored elsewhere. Note that
   a single component can belong to multiple features but this attribute allows you
   to specify only a single feature.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Guid",
      type: "ComponentGuid",
      typeLink: "../componentguid",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type must be a GUID, with or without braces: `01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF` or `{01234567-89AB-CDEF-0123-456789ABCDEF}`. `PUT-GUID-HERE` can be used for sample code. Empty values are also supported."
    }}
  >
  This value should be a guid that uniquely identifies this component's contents, language, platform, and version.
   If omitted, the default value is '*' which indicates that the linker should generate a stable guid.
   Generatable guids are supported only for components with a single file as the component's keypath
   or no files and a registry value as the keypath.
   It's also possible to set the value to an empty string to specify an unmanaged component.
   Unmanaged components are a security vulnerability because the component cannot be removed or repaired
   by Windows Installer (it is essentially an unpatchable, permanent component). Therefore, a guid should
   always be specified for any component which contains resources that may need to be patched in the future.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Component identifier; this is the primary key for identifying components. If omitted,
   the compiler defaults the identifier to the identifier of the resource that is the
   explicit or default keypath of the component (for example, a child File element).
   In WiX v4 and WiX v5, such a default identifier is private to the section where it is
   defined. To make it public (and therefore accessible from other sections and usable
   in references like ComponentRef), give the component an explicit value for Id.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "KeyPath",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  If this attribute's value is set to 'yes', then the Directory of this Component is used
   as the KeyPath. To set a Registry value or File as the KeyPath of a component, set the
   KeyPath attribute to 'yes' on one of those child elements. If KeyPath is not set to 'yes' for the
   Component or for a child Registry value or File, WiX will look at the child elements under the
   Component in sequential order and try to automatically select one of them as a key path. Allowing
   WiX to automatically select a key path can be dangerous because adding or removing child elements
   under the Component can inadvertantly cause the key path to change, which can lead to
   installation problems.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Location",
      type: ""
    }}
  >
  Optional value that specifies the location that the component can be run from. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *local*: Prevents the component from running from the source or the network (this is the default behavior if this attribute is not set).
  - *source*: Enforces that the component can only be run from the source (it cannot be run from the user's computer).
  - *either*: Allows the component to run from source or locally.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "MultiInstance",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  If this attribute is set to 'yes', a new Component/@Guid will be generated for each
   instance transform. Ensure that all of the resources contained in a multi-instance
   Component will be installed to different paths based on the instance Property; otherwise,
   the Component Rules will be violated.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "NeverOverwrite",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  If this attribute is set to 'yes', the installer does not install or reinstall the
   component if a key path file or a key path registry entry for the component already
   exists. The application does register itself as a client of the component. Use this
   flag only for components that are being registered by the Registry table. Do not use
   this flag for components registered by the AppId, Class, Extension, ProgId, MIME, and
   Verb tables.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Permanent",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  If this attribute is set to 'yes', the installer does not remove the component during
   an uninstall. The installer registers an extra system client for the component in
   the Windows Installer registry settings (which basically just means that at least one
   product is always referencing this component). Note that this option differs from the
   behavior of not setting a guid because although the component is permanent, it is still
   patchable (because Windows Installer still tracks it), it's just not uninstallable.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Shared",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  If this attribute's value is set to 'yes', enables advanced patching semantics for
   Components that are shared across multiple MSI packages. Specifically, the Windows Installer
   will cache the shared files to improve patch uninstall. This functionality is available
   in Windows Installer 4.5 and later.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "SharedDllRefCount",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  If this attribute's value is set to 'yes', the installer increments the reference count
   in the shared DLL registry of the component's key file. If this bit is not set, the
   installer increments the reference count only if the reference count already exists.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Subdirectory",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This attribute defines one or more directories below the directory referenced by the Directory attribute or parent
   Directory reference where the Component will be installed.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Transitive",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  If this attribute is set to 'yes', the installer reevaluates the value of the statement
   in the Condition upon a reinstall. If the value was previously False and has changed to
   True, the installer installs the component. If the value was previously True and has
   changed to False, the installer removes the component even if the component has other
   products as clients.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "UninstallWhenSuperseded",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  If this attribute is set to 'yes', the installer will uninstall the Component's files
   and registry keys when it is superseded by a patch. This functionality is available in
   Windows Installer 4.5 and later.
  </BlockReference>
