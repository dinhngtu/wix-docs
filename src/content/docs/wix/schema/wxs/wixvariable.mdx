This element exposes advanced WiX functionality. Use this element to declare WiX variables
 from directly within your authoring. WiX variables are not resolved until the final package
 file is actually generated (bind time). WiX variables do not persist into the package file,
 so they cannot be used when an MSI file is being installed; it's a WiX-only concept.


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  The name of the variable.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Overridable",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Set this value to 'yes' in order to make the variable's value overridable either by
   another WixVariable entry or via the command-line option -d_name_=_value_;
   for light.exe. If the same variable is declared overridable in multiple places it
   will cause an error (since WiX won't know which value is correct). The default value
   is 'no'.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Value",
      type: "string",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  The value of the variable. Note that because values are substituted at bind time,
   they skip all the validation done at compile time, which can be more thorough than
   validation done at bind time.
  </BlockReference>

</BlockWrapper>
