Sets a Directory to a particular value. This is accomplished by creating a Type 51 custom action that is appropriately scheduled in
 the InstallUISequence and InstallExecuteSequence.


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Action",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  By default the action is "Set" + Id attribute's value. This optional attribute can override the action name in the case
   where multiple SetDirectory elements target the same Id (probably with mutually exclusive conditions).
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Condition",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The condition that determines whether the Directory is set. If the condition evaluates to false, the SetDirectory is skipped.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This attribute specifies a reference to a Directory element with matching Id attribute. The path of the Directory will be set to
   the Value attribute.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Sequence",
      type: "SequenceType",
      typeLink: "../sequencetype/",
      typeTitle: "Controls which sequences the item assignment is sequenced in."
    }}
  >
  Controls which sequences the Directory assignment is sequenced in.
   For 'execute', the assignment is scheduled in the InstallExecuteSequence.
   For 'ui', the assignment is scheduled in the InstallUISequence.
   For 'first', the assignment is scheduled in the InstallUISequence or the InstallExecuteSequence if the InstallUISequence is skipped at install time.
   For 'both', the assignment is scheduled in both the InstallUISequence and the InstallExecuteSequence.
   The default is 'both'. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *both*: Schedules the assignment in the InstallUISequence and the InstallExecuteSequence.
  - *first*: Schedules the assignment to run in the InstallUISequence or the InstallExecuteSequence if the InstallUISequence is skipped.
  - *execute*: Schedules the assignment only in the the InstallExecuteSequence.
  - *ui*: Schedules the assignment only in the the InstallUISequence.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Value",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This attribute specifies a string value to assign to the Directory. The value can be a literal value or derived from a
   Property element using the [Formatted](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/formatted) syntax.
