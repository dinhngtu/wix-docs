## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Cabinet",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The name of the cabinet if some or all of the files stored on the media are in a cabinet file. If no cabinets are used, this attribute must not be set.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "CompressionLevel",
      type: "CompressionLevelTypeUnion",
      typeLink: "../compressionleveltype",
      typeTitle: "Indicates the compression level for a cabinet."
    }}
  >
  Indicates the compression level for the Media's cabinet. This attribute can
   only be used in conjunction with the Cabinet attribute. The default is 'medium'.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DiskPrompt",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The disk name, which is usually the visible text printed on the disk. This localizable text is used to prompt the user when this disk needs to be inserted. This value will be used in the "[1]" of the DiskPrompt Property. Using this attribute will require you to define a DiskPrompt Property.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "EmbedCab",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Instructs the binder to embed the cabinet in the product if 'yes'. This attribute can only be specified in conjunction with the Cabinet attribute.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "DiskIdType",
      typeLink: "../diskidtype",
      typeTitle: "Values of this type must be an integer or the value of one or more preprocessor variables with the format `$(Variable)` or `$(var.Variable)`.",
      required: true
    }}
  >
  Disk identifier for Media table. This number must be equal to or greater than 1.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Layout",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This attribute specifies the root directory for the uncompressed files that
   are a part of this Media element. By default, the src will be the output
   directory for the final image. The default value ensures the binder generates
   an installable image. If a relative path is specified in the src attribute,
   the value will be appended to the image's output directory. If an absolute
   path is provided, that path will be used without modification. The latter two
   options are provided to ease the layout of an image onto multiple medias (CDs/DVDs).
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Source",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Optional property that identifies the source of the embedded cabinet.
   If a cabinet is specified for a patch, this property should be defined
   and unique to each patch so that the embedded cabinet containing patched
   and new files can be located in the patch package. If the cabinet is not
   embedded - this is not typical - the cabinet can be found in the directory
   referenced in this column. If empty, the external cabinet must be located
   in the SourceDir directory.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "VolumeLabel",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The label attributed to the volume. This is the volume label returned
   by the GetVolumeInformation function. If the SourceDir property refers
   to a removable (floppy or CD-ROM) volume, then this volume label is
   used to verify that the proper disk is in the drive before attempting
   to install files. The entry in this column must match the volume label
   of the physical media.
