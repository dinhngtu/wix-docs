## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DisableRollback",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Specifies whether the bundle will attempt to roll back packages
   executed in the chain. If "yes" is specified then when a vital
   package fails to install only that package will roll back and the
   chain will stop with the error. The default is "no" which
   indicates all packages executed during the chain will be
   rolledback to their previous state when a vital package fails.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "DisableSystemRestore",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Specifies whether the bundle will attempt to create a system
   restore point when executing the chain. If "yes" is specified then
   a system restore point will not be created. The default is "no" which
   indicates a system restore point will be created when the bundle is
   installed, uninstalled, repaired, modified, etc. If the system restore
   point cannot be created, the bundle will log the issue and continue.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "ParallelCache",
      type: "yesno"
    }}
  >
  Specifies whether the bundle will start installing packages
   while other packages are still being cached. If "yes",
   packages will start executing when a rollback boundary is
   encountered. The default is "no" which dictates all packages
   must be cached before any packages will start to be installed.
  </BlockReference>
