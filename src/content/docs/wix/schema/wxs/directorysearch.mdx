## Remarks

Use the AssignToProperty attribute to search for a file but set the outer property to the directory containing the file. When this attribute is set to 'yes', you may only nest a FileSearch element with a unique Id or define no child element.
 When the parent DirectorySearch/@Depth attribute is greater than 0, the FileSearch/@Id attribute must be absent or the same as the parent DirectorySearch/@Id attribute value, unless the parent DirectorySearch/@AssignToProperty attribute value is 'yes'.
