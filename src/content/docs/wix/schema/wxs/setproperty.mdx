Sets a Property to a particular value. This is accomplished by creating a Type 51 custom action that is appropriately scheduled in
 the InstallUISequence and InstallExecuteSequence.


## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Action",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  By default the action is "Set" + Id attribute's value. This optional attribute can override the action name in the case
   where multiple SetProperty elements target the same Id (probably with mutually exclusive conditions).
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "After",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The name of the standard or custom action after which this action should be performed. Mutually exclusive with
   the Before attribute. A Before or After attribute is required when setting a Property.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Before",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The name of the standard or custom action before which this action should be performed. Mutually exclusive with the After attribute. A Before or After attribute is required when setting a Property.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Condition",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  The condition that determines whether the Property is set. If the condition evaluates to false, the Set is skipped.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This attribute specifies the Property to set to the Value.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Sequence",
      type: "SequenceType",
      typeLink: "../sequencetype/",
      typeTitle: "Controls which sequences the item assignment is sequenced in."
    }}
  >
  Controls which sequences the Property assignment is sequenced in.
   For 'execute', the assignment is scheduled in the InstallExecuteSequence.
   For 'ui', the assignment is scheduled in the InstallUISequence.
   For 'first', the assignment is scheduled in the InstallUISequence or the InstallExecuteSequence if the InstallUISequence is skipped at install time.
   For 'both', the assignment is scheduled in both the InstallUISequence and the InstallExecuteSequence.
   The default is 'both'. This attribute's value must be one of the following:
  - *both*: Schedules the assignment in the InstallUISequence and the InstallExecuteSequence.
  - *first*: Schedules the assignment to run in the InstallUISequence or the InstallExecuteSequence if the InstallUISequence is skipped.
  - *execute*: Schedules the assignment only in the the InstallExecuteSequence.
  - *ui*: Schedules the assignment only in the the InstallUISequence.
  </BlockReference>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Value",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  This attribute specifies a string value to assign to the Property. The value can be a literal value or derived from a
   Property element using the [Formatted](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/msi/formatted) syntax.
