## Attributes

<BlockWrapper>

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Argument",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Value for the command arguments. Note that the resolution of properties in the
   Argument field is limited. A property formatted as [Property] in this field can only be resolved if the property
   already has the intended value when the component owning the verb is installed. For example, for the argument
   "[#MyDoc.doc]" to resolve to the correct value, the same process must be installing the file MyDoc.doc and the
   component that owns the verb.
  </BlockReference>

      title: "Command",
      type: "string"
