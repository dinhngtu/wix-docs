## Remarks

Nesting SqlDatabase under a Component element will result in a SqlDatabase being installed to the machine as the package is installed.

 Nesting SqlDatabase under Package, Fragment, or Module
 results in a database "locator" record being created in
 the SqlDatabase table. This means that the database
 itself is neither installed nor uninstalled by the MSI
 package. It does make the database available for referencing
 from a SqlString or SqlScript record. This allows MSI to install
 SqlScripts or SqlStrings to already existing databases on the machine.
 The install will fail if the database does not exist in these cases.

 The User attribute references credentials specified in a User element.
 If a user is not specified then Windows Authentication will be used by default
 using the credentials of the user performing the install to execute sql
 strings, etc.
