      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  References the Id attribute for a WebDirProperties element that specifies the security and access properties for this website root directory.

  <BlockReference
    content={{
      title: "Id",
      type: "string"
    }}
  >
  Identifier for the WebSite. Used within the MSI package only. If the Id is not specified, it will be generated.

  <BlockReference

  >
  Optional attribute to directly specify the site id of the WebSite. Use this to ensure all web
   sites in a web garden get the same site id. If a number is provided, the site id must be unique
   on all target machines. If "*" is used, the Description attribute will be hashed to create a unique
   value for the site id. This value must be a positive number or a "*" or a formatted value that resolves
   to "-1" (for the same behavior as "*") or a positive number or blank. If this attribute is absent then
   the web site will be located using the WebAddress element associated with the web site.

## Remarks

Nesting WebSite under a Component element will result in a WebSite being installed to the machine as the package is installed.
 Nesting WebSite under Package, Fragment, or Module
 results in a web site "locator" record being created in
 the IIsWebSite table. This means that the web site
 itself is neither installed nor uninstalled by the MSI
 package. It does make the database available for referencing
 from a WebApplication, WebVirtualDir or WebDir record. This allows an MSI to install
 WebApplications, WebVirtualDirs or WebDirs to already existing web sites on the machine.
 The install will fail if the web site does not exist in these cases.
