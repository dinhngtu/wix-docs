This localization project is no longer active. WiX v3.9 R2, currently the latest stable WiX release, contains translations for the languages that used to appear here. 

We also offer alternative, cleaner, more fluent, easier-to-understand translations instead of some localization files in the released package. They differ in some places from the usual wording used by Microsoft in their installations but, in our personal opinion, they use simpler and better language. You are completely free to check them out and decide which one you want to use in your install packages.
