## Reverse Engineering

If you prefer to learn by working backward from a Windows Installer package you have already created, you can run the [WiX decompiler](../overview/alltools/) \(Dark\) to convert your package into WiX authoring and then recompile it using the [WiX compiler](../overview/candle/) \(Candle\) and [WiX linker](../overview/light/) \(Light\).

## Reading Source Code

If you prefer to learn by reading code, WiX is an open source project, and you can look at the source code by reviewing the [How to be a WiX Developer](../wixdev/) topic.
