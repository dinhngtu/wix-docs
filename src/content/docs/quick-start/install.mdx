You've created your first installation package, so let's take it out for a spin.

<Steps>

1. Install the MSI package you built.

   <Code lang="cmd" title="C:\src\QuickStart>" code="msiexec /i bin\Debug\QuickStart.msi /l*v install_log.txt" />

1. Check that your package installed the `example.txt` file as expected.

   <Code lang="cmd" title="C:\src\QuickStart> " code='dir "C:\Program Files (x86)\ACME Corp QuickStart Example"' />

1. Uninstall the MSI package to clean up.

   <Code lang="cmd" title="C:\src\QuickStart>" code="msiexec /x bin\Debug\QuickStart.msi /l*v uninstall_log.txt" />

</Steps>

:::caution[Do as we say, not as we do]
We don't generally recommend testing your package on your development machine. It's better to test in a virtual machine or the Windows Sandbox but this package is about as safe as it can get. YOLO!

## What's next?

Now that you've completed the most basic of setup development tasks, let's throw you on to a virtual team to build something a bit more realistic even if it is all pretend.
